# All about testing will be covered here.  

This project has manual testing only.  

I will talk about how I tested each page in the site.

First will be the landing page index.html.. 

On mobile screens this page will have a header and underneath a navgation bar with a burger which you click to see navigation.  

When I click this I expect it to open and see a menu list with recipes and signup/login : True
When I click this again i expect it to close : True  
When I click the recipes link I expect to be taken to the recipe page : True
When I click the signup/login link I expect to be taken to the signup/login page : True
